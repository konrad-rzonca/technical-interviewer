In practice, ArrayList outperforms LinkedList in most scenarios due to its memory layout advantages, and LinkedList's theoretical benefits only materialize in specific usage patterns where you maintain references to nodes that need modification."

              "description": "`Collections.sort()` uses a mergesort variant with **O(n log n)** time complexity and stability guarantees. For large lists, consider the memory implications of sorting or use specialized structures like **PriorityQueue** for partial sorting. The stability guarantee ensures that equal elements maintain their relative order after sorting, which can be important for multi-pass sorting algorithms or maintaining secondary ordering criteria."

              "description": "Since Java 8, the List interface includes a default `sort(Comparator)` method that can be called directly on list instances. This method provides the same functionality as Collections.sort() but with a more object-oriented syntax. For example, instead of `Collections.sort(myList, comparator)`, you can write `myList.sort(comparator)`. For null comparators, it defaults to natural ordering using Comparable."
