Creating too many threads can exhaust available memory due to their individual stacks."

This optimization reduces garbage collection overhead and improves memory locality, though developers shouldn't rely on it for critical optimizations."

The **Young Generation** contains the **Eden Space** (where new objects are allocated) and **Survivor Spaces** (S0 and S1, where objects surviving minor GCs are stored). The **Old Generation** (also called **Tenured Space**) houses long-lived objects. This division allows the JVM to apply different collection strategies optimized for objects with different lifecycles, improving overall efficiency."

Some collectors add additional phases like **Concurrent Marking** (identifying live objects while application threads run) or **Remembered Set Scanning** (processing references from old to young generation)."

This approach, known as **copying collection**, is efficient for young generation where most objects are expected to die."

The duration of these pauses depends on the collector used and heap characteristics. Traditional collectors like Serial and Parallel GC have longer STW pauses, while CMS, G1, ZGC, and Shenandoah use various techniques like concurrent marking, incremental compaction, and load barriers to minimize pause times, often at the cost of CPU overhead or throughput. Understanding these trade-offs is critical for latency-sensitive applications."

Understanding root types is crucial for diagnosing memory leaks, as objects retained by unexpected roots won't be collected. Tools like Eclipse MAT can show root paths keeping objects alive."

Objects with strong references are never garbage collected while the reference remains accessible from a GC root. Strong references are the default in Java and provide the strictest form of reachability, ensuring objects remain in memory as long as they're referenced. These references don't provide any special interaction with the garbage collector and are appropriate for most application data structures."

Objects that are only softly reachable will be collected at the discretion of the garbage collector, typically only when memory is running low. The JVM guarantees that all soft references will be cleared before throwing an OutOfMemoryError.

Unlike other reference types, phantom references are only enqueued after the object has been finalized but before its memory is reclaimed. This provides a notification mechanism for post-finalization cleanup, especially for off-heap resources. Phantom references must be used with a ReferenceQueue, as their sole purpose is notification, not object access. They provide the cleanest way to implement custom cleanup logic without the risks associated with finalizers."

When the referenced object becomes eligible for garbage collection, the reference object itself (not the referenced object) is added to the queue. Applications can poll or remove from the queue to be notified when references are cleared, facilitating resource cleanup or cache maintenance. For phantom references, queue registration is mandatory, while it's optional for weak and soft references."

Under high memory pressure, the collector becomes more aggressive about clearing soft references, often based on an age-based algorithm. Most JVMs track the last time the heap was at capacity and clear soft references that have been idle since before that time minus a tunable retention period (controlled via `-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB`, defaulting to 1000ms per free MB). This adaptive policy means soft references may live longer in applications with lower memory utilization and be cleared more quickly in memory-constrained environments."
