A single resize requires copying every element to a new array, which can cause noticeable performance spikes in time-sensitive applications. For critical code paths that append many elements, avoiding these resize operations through proper initial capacity settings is an important optimization."

This trade-off between performance and memory usage requires balancing based on the specific application needs - memory-constrained environments might prefer smaller initial capacities with more resizing, while performance-critical applications might prioritize eliminating resize operations even at the cost of some unused capacity."

This growth factor is a compromise between the more aggressive 2x growth (which would reduce resize frequency but potentially waste more memory) and smaller factors that would conserve memory at the cost of more frequent copying operations."

When the approximate final size is known, using the constructor or ensureCapacity() with this value can eliminate all resize operations. For completely unknown sizes, defaulting to the standard initial capacity and growth mechanism is usually appropriate."

The addAll() method attempts to resize efficiently based on the incoming collection size, but when adding many elements through repeated calls or from multiple sources, manual capacity management becomes more important to avoid cascading resize operations."

On a typical 64-bit JVM, the overhead beyond the actual elements can be 24 bytes plus 4-8 bytes per capacity unit (depending on element type), which becomes significant for large lists or many small lists. This makes trimToSize() valuable for long-lived collections that won't grow further."
